Please generate a video of a human's hand grabbing the 008_pudding_box on the table. The camera's perspective, including internal and external parameters, should remain fixed and unchanged throughout the video,which means no camera movement. The human's hand and the 008_pudding_box's motion should follow realistic physics. The  human's hand should exit in the same place where it enters after grasping. Other objects, except for human's hand and 008_pudding_box, should remain in their position.
