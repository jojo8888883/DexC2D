Please generate a video of a human's hand grabbing the cracker on the table. The camera's perspective, including internal and external parameters, should remain fixed and unchanged throughout the video,which means no camera movement. The human's hand and the cracker's motion should follow realistic physics. The  human's hand should exit in the same place where it enters after grasping. Other objects, except for human's  hand and cracker, should remain in their position.
